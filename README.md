After extended time, it still wasnt enough. 
As I stressed through the necessary courses to get a better understanding at java, I sat with confidence til the very end.
This week, as my time got extended gave me more time to learn and build my project. It is not a excuse, but the time went to visiting the hospital with my wife.
On the very last day before my resubmit time, I thought that I had the knowledge to build a fun project. 
i love a game called Destiny 2, and I planned to create a reddit style site for users to upload character build ideas, fashion picture and cool clips.
Walking through the last steps, "Django blog", I noticed I did not have nearly enough knowledge to create a project as I stressed through as much as possible.

This Project is a fail. I even failed deploying the heroku app, and as such, the only way I could pass at this stage is to copy someone else without knowing what the code does. 

This tiny section of codes, I used from the "Django Blog Course". And my intention was to follow it to learn the funtions nad make them my own and changing them all to fit 
destiny 2 theme such as databse connections with destiny 2 servers.

I want this, but I feel i need more time to learn what I am actually doing. 

I would love to lower study rate to 50% to give it all time, but that seems like something impossible this late in the education.

Im sorry I dont have anything to show, but I think honesty is much better then trying to pass something I dont understand.
